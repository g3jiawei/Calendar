Birkhoff Wayne is a 4th year Computer Science student focusing on Network Technology and Artificial Intelligence at U of T St. George Campus. Single. He is a geek. He never goes to the lecture because he thinks he can find everything he wants from Internet. In that case, he brings with his laptop and smartphone all the time. Birkhoff usually spends full day playing with his cool tools, such as 3D-printer, quadrotor helicopter or Google Glasses. He goes to gym everyday. He knows how to control the oven to heat the food or order take-out by using his smartphone.
A typical day for Birkhoff starts early. He watches morning news while he running on the treadmill for an hour. At the same time, he sends instructions to the smart oven to heat last night’s Popeyes by his iPhone. He starts to study at 9:00 everyday. He always finishes studying at around 13:00 since he is super clever. After a half-hour nap, he starts his own project until midnight.

He sometimes forgets to upload his assignment after he finished. And he becomes extremely upset when he noticed that the deadline of his assignment is passed.
