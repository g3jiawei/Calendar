Chuan-Keng Chou:

Chidinma Nwaka:
Hi, my name is Chidinma Nwaka and I am a computer science student at the University of Toronto.
I really like my program because of the hands-on experience I constantly get while taking all
my courses, and the sense of accomplishment I feel when I complete every programming assignment. 
I just started a hobby, which is programming on the web and I love it. I find it fascinating to 
see how multiple connection requests are sent across the web from clients to servers and 
vice versa within seconds. My dream is to become a sunday school teacher, successful entrepreneur a
nd philanthropist. Aside from computer science, I enjoy learning about how businesses start up 
and operate. I enjoy reading about success startup stories at my leisure time because they inspire me. 
I also love spending time with my immediate family and my little cousins. My love for junk food
will never allow me to become a vegetarian.

Shihao Zhao:
Hello, I am Shihao. I'm currently a third year computer science student and I am from China.
In terms of programming language, I have experience with python, java, c, assemblly and SQL,
and I am currently learning HTML, CSS, JS and etc. I really like team working, because it makes
problems and projects easier to approach and brings more fun, especially when you solved some tough 
problems together. Also, I would love to communicate because it is a efficient way to learn and make 
what you did makes more sense to others, which is really crucial. So for now, I am really exited about 
what we will face later in our project and hopefully we will get what we expect.

Hongyi Guo:
My name is Hongyi Guo and I am a 3rd year student in computer science specialist program.
I am familiar with programming languages like Python, Java, C, Racket, javascript and PHP. 
I took CSC309, CSC343 so I have knowledge on programming on the web and databases. I also have 
a little bit expierence on web api and database design. I am hard-working and easy to work with, and I prefer communicating via internet such as email or some other messaging software, as they are 
convenient and efficient.

Zhonghao Liu:
I am taking this course as part of the specialist in computer science program. 
I have experience on teamwork with 6 people before. Also, I am familiar with Python, 
Java, C, SQL, HTML and PHP. I am a friendly person that willing to make friend with everyone.
Furthermore, I like to communicate with people and that give me the advantage to connect 
with my teammates, TA and professors. 

Manke Luo: 
I am Mike, and I am a third-year international student who is enrolled in Computer Science 
Specialist Program. There is no special skill I have, but I am really glad to learn stuff. 
There are some programming languages I am familiar with, like Visual Basic, C, Java. I think 
this group is an excellent group according to our first meeting. Hopefully, this project would 
be a good coding experience for all of us.
