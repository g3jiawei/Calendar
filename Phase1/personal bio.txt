I am taking this course as part of the specialist in computer science program. 
I have experience on teamwork with 6 people before. Also, I am familiar with Python, 
Java, C, SQL, HTML and PHP. I am a friendly person that willing to make friend with everyone.
Furthermore, I like to communicate with people and that give me the advantage to connect 
with my teammates, TA and professors. 

Manke Luo: 
I am Mike, and I am a third-year international student who is enrolled in Computer Science 
Specialist Program. There is no special skill I have, but I am really glad to learn stuff. 
There are some programming languages I am familiar with, like Visual Basic, C, Java. I think 
this group is an excellent group according to our first meeting. Hopefully, this project would 
be a good coding experience for all of us.
