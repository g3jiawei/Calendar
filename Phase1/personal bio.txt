Chidinma Nwaka:
Hi, my name is Chidinma Nwaka and I am a computer science student at the University of Toronto. I really like my program because of the hands-on experience I constantly get while taking all my courses, and the sense of accomplishment I feel when I complete every programming assignment. I just started a hobby, which is programming on the web and I love it. I find it fascinating to see how multiple connection requests are sent across the web from clients to servers and vice versa within seconds. My dream is to become a sunday school teacher, successful entrepreneur and philanthropist. Aside from computer science, I enjoy learning about how businesses start up and operate. I enjoy reading about success startup stories at my leisure time because they inspire me. I also love spending time with my immediate family and my little cousins. My love for junk food will never allow me to become a vegetarian.
