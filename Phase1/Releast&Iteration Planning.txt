In our first iteration, we decided to implement Hongyi’s first user story. The users are able to 
add/modify dates and info. This is the key feature to our whole product and it’s also the minimum 
feature that we have to achieve. In our phase 2, we decide to implement add/modify and count-down.
These features are come from almost everyone’s user stories. They are necessary features for our 
product. However, there are some user stories that we decided to exclude from our release. 
For example, as Birkhoff, he doesn’t want others to see his timetable. In that case, this product
requires login. Also, Both Zhonghao and Chidinma mentioned that as Claire, she wants to share her
calendar and wants to see others shared calendar as well. The reasons that we do not want to 
implement these features in our first release are simple. Compared with add/modify date and push
notifications, login and synchronization just become less important. Users may not have to 
use login to keep their timetable private, but they have to be able to add dates and receive
notifications. Otherwise, this product is useless.
