##Time Management Tool for Students.

Time management is a necessary skill everyone needs to have in order to be very successful in whatever he or she does.
Our team chose the ‘Time Management Tool for Students’ to work on as our project. We as students have seen ourselves 
and other students having a hard time keeping up with all the many things we need to do at every point in time. 
Some of us also work part-time and having work shifts times might vary every week. Having all this in mind, we plan to
create an application which allows every student put in his or her lecture and tutorial times, as well as all due dates,
in one place. We will also integrate a reminder / notification system which would notify its users on things that are 
due before hand. We as human beings think in pictures. Our application will provide a pictorial view of when everything 
is due to its users as they work towards meeting all they have to do before the deadlines. We as a team chose to do 
this project because we believe that it is feasible to complete and students can use our application in their day-to-day
lives as they all work towards managing their time effectively.
