Application that takes in a user's unique class schedule. At the same time, other users' 
schedule are being stored as well. For those students enrolled in the same courses,
they will receive the same notifications and same information feed. Information such
as the course assignments, lecture duration and many more. What makes this application special is the emphasis on time, making time a commodity(in student's life) which was never really a focus of other calendar applications. Furthermore, this emphasis relays on the calendar interphase which we implemented from the ground up!
