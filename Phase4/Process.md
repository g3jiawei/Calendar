**Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that worked well for your team. Explain why.**

Tools we use:

* Eclipse and Android ADT plug-in
	
	We used Eclipse and Android ADT to implement our UI and backend classes. The reason why we chose those was we are all familiar with Java and Eclipse. It is a fairly easy IDE as well. Also, Android ADT plug-in is nicely support by Eclipse. 
	
* Github

	Github is a very good version control and code sharing tool. Our team really appreciates the git command tutorial during class. When we encountered bugs on our application, we can always scroll back to the previous commit to spot the bugs. 

* Facebook

	Our team created a private Facebook group (csc301 group) for our communication. During our development, teammates are always reachable by using Facebook.
	
* Google Cloud Platform

	By using Google Cloud Platform, we can make our server and database online. This will make our presentation easier since we do not have to setup another computer as our localhost. On the other hand, when TA or professor goes through our source code/application, it will be  convenient to run our application directly without any further localhost server/database setup. 
	
	Also, Google Cloud Platform have a better support for MySQL than Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. 
	
* Nexus 5(real app testing) and Genymotion(emulator)

	Since we are working on Android application, there is no devices better than Nexus phone. Fortunately, one of our teammates own a Nexus 5 with the latest Android OS(Android Lollipop). 
	
	As for other developer who does not have Android phone, we choose to use an third-party emulator called Genymotion. It supports all the main operating systems(Mac OS X, Windows 32/64 bits and Linux 32/64 bits). It is a perfect emulator for us since computers in CDF labs do not currently support Android emulator with Android L. On the other hand, Genymotion is much faster than the emulator in Eclipse.

**Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that didn't work well for your team. Explain why.**

* Github issue

	It is true that github issue is a good tool for a big team to find and solve problems. However, for a relatively smaller team like us, we can just post stuff on Facebook and tell everyone the bugs we encountered. It is a lot easier than catching and solving issues on github. 
	
	
**If you had to continue working as a team, and design your process, what would your process look like?**

The current team work and process is actually pretty good. We splited into small groups and worked on different parts of the project. 3 members worked on UI, 2 members worked on the backend classes and 2 people worked on server, database and all the paperworks. We had weekly meetings to update all of our work and used Facebook to update small changes.
