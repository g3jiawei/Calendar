**Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that worked well for your team. Explain why.**

Tools we use:

* Eclipse and Android ADT plug-in
	
	We use Eclipse and Android ADT to implement our UI and backend classes. The reason that we choose is because we all familiar with Java and eclipse is a fairly easy IDE. Also, Android ADT plug-in have a very good support on Eclipse. 
	
* Github

	Github is a very good version control and code sharing tool. Our team really appreciate the git command tutorial during class. When we counter bugs on our application, we can always scroll back to the previous commit to spot the bugs. 

* Facebook

	Our team created a private Facebook group (csc301 group) for our communication. During our development, teammates are always reachable by using Facebook.
	
* Google Cloud Platform

	By using Google Cloud Platform, we can make our server and database online. This will make our presentation easier since we do not have to setup another computer as our localhost. On the other hand, when TA or professor look through our source code/application, it is convenient to run our application directly without any further localhost server/database setup. 
	
	Also, Google Cloud Platform have a better support MySQL than Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. 
	
* Nexus 5(real app testing) and Genymotion(emulator)

	Since we are working on Android application, there is no devices better than Nexus phone. Fortunately, one of our teammate own a Nexus 5 with the latest Android OS(Android Lollipop). 
	
	As for other developers who does not have Android phone, we choose to use an third-party emulator called Genymotion. It support all main operating systems(Mac OS X, Windows 32/64 bits and Linux 32/64 bits). It is a perfect emulator for us since CDF labs are not currently supporting Android emulator with Android L. On the other hand, Genymotion is much faster than the emulator from Eclipse.

**Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that didn't work well for your team. Explain why.**

* Github issue

	It is true that github issue is a very good tool for a big team finding and solving problems. However, for a relatively smaller team like us, we can just post message on Facebook and tell everyone the bugs we found. It will be a lot easier than catch and solve issues on github. 
	
	
**If you had to continue working as a team, and design your process, what would your process look like?**

The current team work and process is actually pretty good. We split into small groups working on different part of the project. 3 people working on UI, 2 people working on backend classes and 2 people working on server, database and all of the paperworks. We have weekly meeting to update all of our work and use Facebook to update small changes.
