# Individual Reports

## Name (GitHub username)

Here is an example of a fake report, just to give you an idea of the format we are expecting.
We would like you to be concise yet informative.

 * My most significant contribution was the design and implementation of Component X (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * While working on our Android app (and then later in class), I learned about adapters (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * I am always helping my teammates - I am the most experienced coder on the team, and I helped other teammates set up their development environment, and get up to speed with the tools we've used (give examples of specific tools).
 * I could keep people more informed of what I am doing - I made a few large commits that conflicted with everybody else's code, and merging everything wasted a lot of our time.

* My most significant contribution was connecting the server and client (e.g. fnished the GET function by decoding JSON strings from the server)
* While working on our Android app, I learned about how to get infomation from server, and how to test my code using a real Android phone. 
* I talked to the one who wrote server and the one who is coding the Android app at the same time. I asked them what they have and what they need. Furthermore, I pointed out their bugs and helped them fix these bugs.
* I should help my teammates more often after finishing my job, so that we can have an app with less bugs and more functions.

## Name (Jiawei Li)

 * My most significant contribution was the design and implementation of android app (https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team10-repo/tree/master/Phase4/android-calendar-card-master).
 * While working on our Android app (and then later in class), I learned a bunch of skills on how to build an app and how to develope it step by step. Also I understand how to import libraries to our app to make it more powerful and how to add the theme to make it looks cool.                                                                                            (links to library -- https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team10-repo/tree/master/Phase4/android-calendar-card-master/calendar-card-sample/libs                                                                                            links to theme -- https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team10-repo/blob/master/Phase4/android-calendar-card-master/calendar-card-sample/res/values/styles.xml                                                                             links to activities -- https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team10-repo/tree/master/Phase4/android-calendar-card-master/calendar-card-sample/src/com/wt/calendarcardsample).
 * I did a lot of hard coding including desiging data structures and implementing functions - I am working on both activity side and backend side, and used a HashMap to save data whcih is quite powerful data structure. And I implemented (add search modify delete) functions to handle these data to achieve our MVP in phaseII. Finally I matched the data to the dates to make the app more visualizable. 
 * I could implement more stuff - I once want to add pushing notification function to this app, but it seems difficult and I don't have enough time to do that, whcih is a big pity for me. If there is more time for me, I could do better.

## Name (chouchua)
* My most significant contribution was the review/generation of the reports to be handed in for each phase and the idea generation/ product design in Phase 1.
 * While working on our Android app, I learned about essential libraries to use for the android environment and then running the emulator Genymotion. Another useful technique is being able to read JSON responses from the database, however I was not responsible to parse the JSON response. Also, experienced how the design pattern is essential to task distribution.
 * I understood the implementation of the server and helped to communicate the logic of the server to the one responsible for the connection between server and client. Also, I took the lead in idea generation/product design in the first phase, which was convenient for me to elaborate on the reports.
 * I could have assisted more in the development process, but most of the time I played catch up to others' technical skills. Being assigned in the server/database was a challenge, but in the end all worked well.
