# Individual Reports

-----

## Name (GitHub username)

Here is an example of a fake report, just to give you an idea of the format we are expecting.
We would like you to be concise yet informative.

 * My most significant contribution was the design and implementation of Component X (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * While working on our Android app (and then later in class), I learned about adapters (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * I am always helping my teammates - I am the most experienced coder on the team, and I helped other teammates set up their development environment, and get up to speed with the tools we've used (give examples of specific tools).
 * I could keep people more informed of what I am doing - I made a few large commits that conflicted with everybody else's code, and merging everything wasted a lot of our time.

## Zhonghao Liu (liuzhon4)

* My most significant contribution in Phase 4 is the final presentation, Process and Architecture 
	* [Final presentation](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team10-repo/commit/73471bed89e2ec6b0756d7f515808016fa518fd7)
	* [Process](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team10-repo/commit/ca6f0d66f8aab2be1799c139cee2dc7b8ca0557f)
	* [Architecture](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team10-repo/commit/66e15dfa8a666ea0b2fbfa2d0fedaa036735b474)

* While working on our Android app, I learned about how to **PUT**, **FETCH** and **POST** data from our app to server with the help of Hongyi and Manke.  

* I am always available to my teammates. Also, I help my teammates to setup Eclipse&Android environment and emulator.

* I am not very good at Android programming. I need to keep asking friends or learn them myself.

## Manke Luo (luomanke)

* My most significant contribution was connecting the server and client (e.g. fnished the GET function by decoding JSON strings from the server) 
	* [Server Connection](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team10-repo/tree/server-connection)
* While working on our Android app, I learned about how to get infomation from server, and how to test my code using a real Android phone. 
	* [GET/POST on Android](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team10-repo/tree/server-connection/MyHttpTester/src/Elvenware/MyTester)
* I talked to the one who wrote server and the one who is coding the Android app at the same time. I asked them what they have and what they need. Furthermore, I pointed out their bugs and helped them fix these bugs.
* I should help my teammates more often after finishing my job, so that we can have an app with less bugs and more functions.

## Jiawei Li (g3jiawei)

 * My most significant contribution was the design and implementation of android app (https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team10-repo/tree/master/Phase4/android-calendar-card-master).
 * While working on our Android app (and then later in class), I learned a bunch of skills on how to build an app and how to develope it step by step. Also I understand how to import libraries to our app to make it more powerful and how to add the theme to make it looks cool.                                                                                            (links to library -- https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team10-repo/tree/master/Phase4/android-calendar-card-master/calendar-card-sample/libs                                                                                            links to theme -- https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team10-repo/blob/master/Phase4/android-calendar-card-master/calendar-card-sample/res/values/styles.xml                                                                             links to activities -- https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team10-repo/tree/master/Phase4/android-calendar-card-master/calendar-card-sample/src/com/wt/calendarcardsample).
 * I did a lot of hard coding including desiging data structures and implementing functions - I am working on both activity side and backend side, and used a HashMap to save data whcih is quite powerful data structure. And I implemented (add search modify delete) functions to handle these data to achieve our MVP in phaseII. Finally I matched the data to the dates to make the app more visualizable. 
 * I could implement more stuff - I once want to add pushing notification function to this app, but it seems difficult and I don't have enough time to do that, whcih is a big pity for me. If there is more time for me, I could do better.

## Chuan-Keng Chou (chouchua)
* My most significant contribution was the review/generation of the reports to be handed in for each phase and the idea generation/ product design in Phase 1.
* While working on our Android app, I learned about essential libraries to use for the android environment and then running the emulator Genymotion. Another useful technique is being able to read JSON responses from the database, however I was not responsible to parse the JSON response. Also, experienced how the design pattern is essential to task distribution.
* I understood the implementation of the server and helped to communicate the logic of the server to the one responsible for the connection between server and client. Also, I took the lead in idea generation/product design in the first phase, which was convenient for me to elaborate on the reports.
* I could have assisted more in the development process, but most of the time I played catch up to others' technical skills. Being assigned in the server/database was a challenge, but in the end all worked well.

## Shihao Zhao(Shihao66)
* My most significant individual contribution is the implementation of backend and UI part, including backend classes like student and activities like CourseListActivity etc.
 Link: https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team10-repo/commit/13df197e2207f30d4d62264a7e1f82069be874ab
* One thing I learned is that in a real app development process, it's crucial to find a good mature prototype(library) at the first place, because this starting point can determine how far and how difficult you can implement your ideas. If you want to build a perfect calendar, for example, you should find the best prototype at first.

* My main strength is the flexibility I have while implementing our app, I could find the gaps we need to fill at that moment and find the way to solve/implement it. 
* My main weakness is that I could not make fully use of what I have learnt before. For example, I have learnt database(csc343) before, but I did not help much on that part. So I find it is important to trully understand and integrate what you are learning from each course, and always: the deeper the better.


## Hongyi Guo(guohongyi)
* My most significant individual contribution is the server. Basically, I designed the database, wrote the server and its document, and put it on the internet. Also, I provided some help to our android team, mainly about http request and JSON.
	* http://dev-firmament-772.appspot.com/index.php/api/

* I learned to use MVC pattern as well as REST architecture for the server api.

* My main strength as a team member is that I am capable to do things efficiently and in high quality. The server is done nicely all by myself.

* My main weakness is probably lack of communication. During the project we are not very well organized and sometimes members didn't know what they should be doing.
* 




## Name (g3nwakac)

* My most significant contrubution was in the designing of the crc cards, user stories and the DAO Design Pathern. 
	 Link: https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-Morning-Team10-repo/blob/master/Phase3/
* While working on our Android app, I learnt how the MVC works and how to implement it. 
* My main strength is my ability to test and debug code.
* My weakness was when I keep on procastinating on getting my part done until a few days before it was due.
