# Individual Reports

## Name (GitHub username)

Here is an example of a fake report, just to give you an idea of the format we are expecting.
We would like you to be concise yet informative.

 * My most significant contribution was the design and implementation of Component X (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * While working on our Android app (and then later in class), I learned about adapters (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * I am always helping my teammates - I am the most experienced coder on the team, and I helped other teammates set up their development environment, and get up to speed with the tools we've used (give examples of specific tools).
 * I could keep people more informed of what I am doing - I made a few large commits that conflicted with everybody else's code, and merging everything wasted a lot of our time.

* My most significant contribution was connecting the server and client (e.g. fnished the GET function by decoding JSON strings from the server)
* While working on our Android app, I learned about how to get infomation from server, and how to test my code using a real Android phone. 
* I talked to the one who wrote server and the one who is coding the Android app at the same time. I asked them what they have and what they need. Furthermore, I pointed out their bugs and helped them fix these bugs.
* I should help my teammates more often after finishing my job, so that we can have an app with less bugs and more functions.
