Our value proposition is the following:
Manage course content in the most convenient way, both offline and online. Online provides the immediate feed from classmates as opposed to the traditional information generated from the instructor. Reversely, asking questions to the right audience. Ultimately improve your academic efficiency in a mobile-friendly environment, in terms of information receiving and collaboration.

Many use cases and personas were analyzed before the product development. Our design closely reinforces the need of students and we focussed on the time importance of the courses, exemplified by the countdown function, calendar interface and many others.
The typical user is immediately educated of the benefits of using iCalendar. The focus is optimally emphasized with the use of a cover page that allows the user to register, this will be added on in later phases when product is complete to vision.  
It's all about the focus, afterall it is a student niche product.

The user starts by loading their data, and our database will provide previously entered information to the user. 
Load data button is to allow the student to log in, which we consider as a synonym to log in. The choice of words is to play a subconscious role in the user mentality, where they have to load their course information to be able to access the functionalities of the application.

To achieve our vision, great user experience is needed to highlight and transmit our value proposition.
Without user input, the user will not have the managing capability of iCalendar. Our database has a repository of all the courses in a certain institution. Thereby, the student can add an enrolled course and this is displayed on the calendar.
Adding courses is more indicative of a person's background and interests than individual committments. Since a course embodies 
many students, this is classified as a common interest.

The student will have acesss to other publicly posted information in the form of discussion and shared deadlines, these are accesed from the "MY CALENDER" or the "CURRENT COURSES" button. This information flow is described in the next paragraph, and emphasized through our interface.

The emphasis of a virtual calendar is done through the calendar interface. The added committment(in terms of an assignment/test ) by pressing on a time slot in the calendar, acts as a reminder to the student. Thereby, this is also immediately reminded to the user in the main menu under the button "COUNT DOWN". But note, this is "not the count down of your life" as mentioned in our presentation. Currently, only the earliest upcoming committment is being set, but more will be added in later development phases. Regarding the relevant course information, when pressed "CURRENT COURSES", a list of courses enrolled is diplayed in a list. Entering any enrolled course with a click of a button will reveal Assignment, Test information. Not only that, we aim to create an unique discusion board that will have annonymous functions and others listed below.

However, this product has the potential to rise above the student niche with the addition of the following functionality. This essential feature that has not been completed is the synchronization of schedules between students. Students will be able to have visibility of others in the same class and provided the ability to locate and then chat with the specific classmates. This immediately relates to the current design where users add courses/committments they have, because the registeration of committed course is a direct visibility for other people enrolled in the same course.

Furthermore, the synchronization with a specific student that has also "loaded their data", allows the paired users to find common available times that they can collaborate on. With the embodiment of common interests(as described as course committments), we will implement a group-focussed feature where students can communicate with one another, knowing that others are on there.

All in all, iCalendar is a simplistic design, but powerful in collaboration and management given the above detailed description. Intuitive for personal use and imperative for relevant course information. While many appilcations are often used beyond of their original purposed design, such as the facebook groups being used for courses. We predict that iCalendar will be used by students as another form of communication, time-based. This type of communication is not only annonymousity, but also impowering everyone to freely ask within a community.
