The goals of this report are:
Inform potential users of the major product decisions you made:
Which features (that weren't a part of the original handout) did you choose to focus on?
How do you expect a typical user to use your product? (i.e. run us through a quick scenario or two).
Give your TA and/or instructor some context, before they see your live presentation.

Our value proposition is the following:
Manage course content in the most convenient way, both offline and online. Online provides the immediate feed from classmates as opposed to the traditional information generated from the instructor. Reversely, asking questions to the right audience. Ultimately improve your academic efficiency in a mobile-friendly environment, in terms of information receiving and collaboration.
The typical user is immediately educated of the benefits of using iCalendar. The focus is optimally emphasized with the use of a cover page that allows the user to register, this will be added on in later phases when product is complete to vision.  
It's all about the focus, afterall it is a student focussed product.

However, this product has the potential to rise above the student niche with the addition of the following functionality. This additional feature that has not been completed is the synchronization between schedules. Students will be able to have visibility of others in the same class and provided the ability to locate and then chat with the specific classmate. This immediately relates to the current design where users optionally add courses/committments they have, because the registeration of committed course is a direct visibility for other people enroleed in the same course.

To achieve our vision, great user experience is needed to highlight and transmit our value proposition.
Without user input, the user will not have the managing capability of iCalendar. Our database has a repository of all the courses in a certain institution. Thereby, the student can add an enrolled course and this is displayed on the calendar.
Adding courses is more indicative of a person's background and interests than individual committments. Since a course embodies 
many students, this is classified as a common interest.
Load data button is to allow the student to log in, which we consider as a synonym to log in. The choice of words is to play a subconscious role in the user mentality, where they have to load their course information to be able to access the functionalities of the application.

The emphasis of a virtual calendar is done through the calendar interface. The added committment in terms of an assignment and ...

The is immediately reminded to the user in the main menu under the button "COUNT DOWN". But note, this is "not the count down of your life" as mentioned in our presentation. Currently, only the earliest upcoming committment is being set, but more will be added in later development phases.

With the embodiment of common interests, we would like to implement a group-focussed feature where students can communicate with one another, knowing that others are on there.
While many appilcations are often used beyond of their original purposed design, such as the facebook groups being used for course.

Icalendar is a simplistic design, but powerful given the above detailed description....
