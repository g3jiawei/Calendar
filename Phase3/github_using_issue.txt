We also met some problems with git and github using. The situation was that we had several people working on 
the classes and interface, which were in the same project file. In this case, when each person tried to commit(push) 
some changes, there would be some crashes, which means we had to pull first, which would possiblly change our local
files. This is dangerous. So at that time, instead of pushing to an existed branch, we made new branches when there
was a crash. At the end, we had too many branches.
